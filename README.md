# RegCombin: Linear regression under Data Combination.

We implement linear regression when the outcome of interest and some of the covariates are observed in two different datasets that cannot be linked, based on D'Haultfoeuille, Gaillac, and Maurel (2022), “Partially Linear Models under Data Combination”. 

The package allows for common regressors observed in both datasets, and for sign constraints on the effect of covariates on the outcome of interest.

See the RegCombin's vignette https://github.com/cgaillac/RegCombin/blob/master/RegCombin_vignette.pdf for code examples. 

For a complete description of the method, see D’Haultfoeuille X, Gaillac C, Maurel A (2022). “Partially Linear Models under Data Combination” Working paper.
